React + TypeScript + Vite Agriculture Data Analytics
This project is a React application built with TypeScript and Vite to analyze agricultural data. The app processes and visualizes data from the Manufac_India_Agro_Dataset.json file, displaying tables for yearly crop production and averages using clean code, modular components, and a responsive design.
Features
React + TypeScript: Provides type safety and modular development.
Vite: Ensures fast development and hot module replacement (HMR).
Mantine UI Library: Used for building responsive and styled tables.
Data Processing: Prepares data from JSON for meaningful insights.
Custom ESLint Configuration: Enforces coding standards and best practices.

Components

1. YearlyTable
   Displays crops with the maximum and minimum production for each year.
   Fetches data from Manufac_India_Agro_Dataset.json.
   Fully responsive with styles managed in YearlyTable.module.css.
2. AverageTable
   Displays average crop yield and cultivation area from 1950â€“2020.
   Data preprocessing is modularized in helper.ts.
   Customization
   ESLint
   We use a custom ESLint configuration to maintain code quality and consistency:

Type-Aware Lint Rules: Enabled through tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked.
React Plugin: Enforces React best practices.
To extend or modify:

Open eslint.config.js.
Update rules or settings as needed.
